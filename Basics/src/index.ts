    → is an extension to JavaScript both run simultaneously
    → deals with data types and addresses other shortcomings of JavaScript
    → shows errors not in runtime, so you can see them earlier
    → needs to be transpiled into a JavaScript file
    → helps you write better code
    → adds static typing for type checking
    → refactoring
    → Shorthand notations
    → contains everything JavaScript has
